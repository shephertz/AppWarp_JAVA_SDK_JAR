Sample
========
The sample illustrates how to set up a NetBeans project with the AppWarp SDK. It is a trivial Swing application which shows how user can join the app's zone, perform room operations
and chat/update rooms using the AppWarp APIs.
Please update the call to WarpClient.initialize with the Api and Secret key pair received while signing up.
